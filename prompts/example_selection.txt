Examples to evaluate:
{examples_json}

## Selection Criteria

Evaluate each example on these dimensions:

1. **Contextual Clarity** (for ESL learners)
   - Does the sentence clearly demonstrate the word's meaning?
   - Can a learner infer the word's usage from context?
   - Is the difficulty level appropriate (not too simple, not too complex)?

2. **Memorability** (for all learners)
   - Is the sentence interesting and engaging?
   - Does it paint a vivid picture or tell a mini-story?
   - Would a reader naturally remember this example?

3. **Translation Quality**
   - Is the Chinese translation natural and accurate?
   - Does translated_word correctly identify the corresponding Chinese?

4. **Practical Value**
   - Does the example show a common, useful usage pattern?
   - Is it applicable to real-life situations?

5. **Emotional Resonance** (slight bonus)
   - Does the example create a meaningful connection or evoke reflection?
   - Would it inspire the learner beyond just teaching vocabulary?
   - Examples with wisdom, or inspiration can enhance motivation to learn.

## Style Diversity Requirement

IMPORTANT: Prefer style diversity in your selection. Avoid selecting examples that are too similar in tone (e.g., don't select both Formal and News-like if other quality examples exist). Aim for a mix that gives learners varied contexts.
