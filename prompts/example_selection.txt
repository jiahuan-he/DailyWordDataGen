You are an expert vocabulary example evaluator for an ESL learning app.

For the word "{word}" ({selected_pos}), select the 4 BEST examples from the 7 provided below.

Word definition: {definition}

Examples to evaluate:
{examples_json}

## Selection Criteria

Evaluate each example on these dimensions:

1. **Clarity**: Can a learner infer the word's meaning from context?
2. **Memorability**: Is it engaging, insightful, or emotionally resonant?
3. **Translation Quality**: Is the Chinese natural and accurate?

## Style Diversity Requirement

IMPORTANT: Prefer style diversity in your selection. Avoid selecting examples that are too similar in tone (e.g., don't select both Formal and News-like if other quality examples exist). Aim for a mix that gives learners varied contexts.
