For the word "{word}" with available parts of speech: [{pos}]

Step 1: Select Part of Speech
- If the list above is not empty, pick the most common/natural usage from it
- If the list is empty, determine the most appropriate part of speech yourself

Step 2: Define the Word
Provide a dictionary-style Chinese definition for the selected part of speech ONLY:
- Use 2-4 short terms (1-3 words each), separated by semicolons
- Example: "辞职；放弃；顺从" NOT "辞职；自愿离开某个工作岗位或职务"

Step 3: Generate 7 Example Sentences
Create one sentence per style below. Prioritize naturalness over all other qualities.

Styles:
1. Formal: professional, journalistic, news-like
2. Definitional: clear, concise, explaining meaning
3. Contrastive: comparative, distinguishing from alternatives
4. Collocational: showcasing common phrases or pairings
5. Philosophical: thought-provoking, reflective
6. Poetic: lyrical, metaphorical, vivid imagery
7. Inspirational: motivating, uplifting, empowering

Rules:
- Keep sentences short and natural
- Do not use em dash (—); use colons or semicolons instead
- Avoid first-person pronouns (I, we, my, our); use second-person or third-person
- All examples must use the word as the selected part of speech
- In translations, use single quotes ('word') instead of double quotes when quoting words

Step 4: Translate
Translate each sentence into natural Chinese. Prioritize fluent Chinese over word-for-word correspondence.
