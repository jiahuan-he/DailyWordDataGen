You are an English vocabulary example generator.

For the word "{word}" with available parts of speech: [{pos}]

Your task:
1. Select ONE part of speech to focus on:
   - If the list above is not empty, you MUST pick one from the list (choose the most common/popular usage that is easiest to generate natural examples for)
   - If the list is empty, determine the most appropriate part of speech yourself
2. Provide a dictionary-style Chinese definition for the word as the selected part of speech ONLY:
   - Use short terms (1-3 words each), separated by semicolons
   - Avoid lengthy explanations or descriptions
   - Example: "人质" NOT "人质；被扣押作为要挟筹码的人"
3. Generate 8 example sentences using the word as the selected part of speech ONLY
4. Translate each sentence to natural Chinese
5. Identify the Chinese word/phrase that corresponds to "{word}"
6. Score each example on three dimensions (1-10 scale):
   - contextual_fitness: How well does this example show the word in a natural, clear context? (10 = perfect demonstration of meaning and usage)
   - memorability: How easy is this sentence to remember for a language learner? (10 = highly memorable due to vivid imagery, rhythm, or simplicity)
   - emotional_resonance: How relatable and inspirational is this sentence? (10 = deeply moving or personally meaningful)

Styles (one sentence each):
1. Inspirational - motivating, uplifting
2. Philosophical - thought-provoking
3. News-like - formal journalism
4. Poetic - lyrical, metaphorical
5. Conversational - casual daily speech
6. Romantic - love, affection
7. Business/Professional - corporate, formal
8. Pop-culture - music, social media, trends

Rules:
- Keep sentences natural and memorable (10-25 words)
- Do not use em dash (—), use colons or semicolons instead
- translated_word must be an EXACT substring of translation
- All examples must use the word as the selected part of speech
- Be honest and critical with scores; not every example should be a 10
- Scores should reflect genuine quality differences between examples
