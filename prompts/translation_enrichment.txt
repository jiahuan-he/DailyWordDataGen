For the word "{word}" ({selected_pos}), identify the Chinese translation of the word in each example.

Examples:
{examples_json}

For each example, find the exact Chinese word or phrase in the translation that corresponds to "{word}".

Rules:
- translated_word must be an EXACT substring of the translation
- Choose the most specific translation (not the whole phrase if a single word suffices)
- If the word is implied but not directly translated, use the closest equivalent

Output as JSON:
{{
  "results": [
    {{"index": 0, "translated_word": "..."}},
    {{"index": 1, "translated_word": "..."}},
    ...
  ]
}}
